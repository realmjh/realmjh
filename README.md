# Mason J. Hawkins

17, Oakland FL. Started this cybersecurity stuff because of the Matrix. Shoutout to Morpheus.

## What I'm Working With

**Languages:** C#, Python, JavaScript, Java, C++  
**Specialty:** Digital forensics/Intelligence, Cybersecurity, Programming

I love tracking and tracing things. I consider myself to be a master of social engineering. If someone leaves something behind online, I'll find it. You'd be really surprised to find out how much of your information is out there. 

## Current Projects

Building a custom encryption method for school that's probably way more complicated than it needs to be. But if you're gonna do something, go big or go home. 

I'm also currently working on an experimental ALPR (Automatic License Plate Reader) System in Python. 

More projects dropping soon once I stop procrastinating and actually finish them.

## Other Hobbies

ðŸš— **Cars** - I'm a big fan of German Cars. I drive an AMG, and it's the best choice I ever made. 

ðŸ“¸ **Photography** - I'm a big fan of photography. Lately I've been dabbling in vintage photography. Maybe I'll start a digital album for y'all to comb through. 

ðŸ”§ **Vintage Electronics** - Currently restoring a Macintosh Plus and pretending I know what I'm doing with a soldering iron  

## The Master Plan

I don't usually like talking about my plans for the future online, but this is what I'm planning to do. 

College for cybersecurity/national security â†’ Military service â†’ Federal government (or a company)

## Fun Fact

I once "accidentally" breached my elementary school's grading system. In my defense, their security was non-existent. Taught me that most systems are way less secure than people think.

## Hit Me Up
Feel free to contact me. Don't bother using your little OSINT tools on my email, you won't find anything. 
Someone bothering you? Don't know who they are? Repeatedly harrasing you over the phone? Send me an email. I'll track them down and report them for you.
